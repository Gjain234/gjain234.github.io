Hello! My name is [Gauri](https://youtu.be/DZ6DOqpxTjg?t=8) and I'm a third year Computer Science PhD student at Harvard. I am excited about all things related to using technology (carefully!!) to make the world better. For my research, I'm especially interested in applying concepts in optimization and machine learning to problems in public health and immigration. 

Before Harvard, I worked at Meta as a software engineer on Marketplace and Integrity products in the Bay Area and London. And before that, I studied computer science at Cornell University. 

I also love teaching (probably unsurprising given how overly energetic this page is)! Some of my favorite teaching experiences I've had so far are as a middle school math and cs instructor with [Breakthrough](https://www.breakthroughcollaborative.org/teach/), a Physics TA with the [Cornell Prison Education Program](https://cpep.cornell.edu/), and a Section Leader with the [Stanford Code in Place Program](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/). If any of my background interests you, please reach out! I could probably learn a thing or two from you.
